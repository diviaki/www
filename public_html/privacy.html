<p><em>DEBRECEN, Hungary, Nov 27, 2019 (Ákos Diviánszky)</em></p>
<p>My digital creatures do not collect any information about you or the devices they interact with.</p>
<p>However as a visitor of this web page my web server already logged the information that come with the request and retains that for 2 weeks to be used by me to understand and fix issues. If you are interested about it search the web for <em>HTTP headers my browser sending</em>.</p>
<p>Yet this page request is one additional data point that agents between my server and you (like the browser, hotspot operator, Internet service provider, backbone gateways operated by governments or businesses) also logged. Your privacy decreases with each additional data point. Search the web for <em>de-anonymization</em> and <em>data re-identification</em> to educate yourself.</p>
